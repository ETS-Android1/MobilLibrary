## A.INTRODUCTION
A new book is released every day. Every day we want to buy and read new books. These books turn into stacks. Because new books are added every time. Our libraries in homes are getting complicated. What book was at home? We find it difficult to remember. We forget the number of our books. We decided to design this application to get rid of this complexity. All our books will be listed. Photographs of each book will be found. It is an application that I can access the tag of the book even if the book is not with me. Thus, the probability of buying two from a book is zeroed. The first reason for the emergence of this practice is to avoid buying more than one of the same books.
Before starting this project, we thought about what we can do and examined similar applications that were previously made. There are many web pages and applications related to the book in the market. Our goal is to design an application that will be enjoyed while using a more useful application . For this, we first created a simple hand drawing of how the application would look like and what pages could be (Figure1). Then using these hand drawings prototype application [17].  We reshaped it and the actual look of the application came out.
